[[info | System contracts required]]
| These instructions assume you want to launch a producing node on a network with **system contracts loaded**. These instructions will not work on a default development node using native functionality, or one without system contracts loaded.

## Goal

This section describes how to set up a producing node within the ARISEN network. A producing node, as its name implies, is a node that is configured to produce blocks in an `ARISEN` based blockchain. This functionality if provided through the `producer_plugin` as well as other [Aos Plugins](../../03_plugins/index.md).

## Before you begin

* [Install the ARISEN software](../../../00_install/index.md) before starting this section.
* It is assumed that `aos`, `arisecli`, and `awalletd` are accessible through the path. If you built ARISEN using shell scripts, make sure to run the [Install Script](../../../00_install/01_build-from-source/01_shell-scripts/03_install-arisen-binaries.md).
* Know how to pass [Aos options](../../02_usage/00_aos-options.md) to enable or disable functionality.

## Steps

Please follow the steps below to set up a producing node:

1. [Register your account as a producer](#1-register-your-account-as-a-producer)
2. [Set Producer Name](#2-set-producer-name)
3. [Set the Producer's signature-provider](#3-set-the-producers-signature-provider)
4. [Define a peers list](#4-define-a-peers-list)
5. [Load the Required Plugins](#5-load-the-required-plugins)

### 1. Register your account as a producer

In order for your account to be eligible as a producer, you will need to register the account as a producer:

```sh
arisecli system regproducer accountname1 RSN1234534... http://producer.site Antarctica
```

### 2. Set Producer Name

Set the `producer-name` option in `config.ini` to your account, as follows:

```console
# config.ini:

# ID of producer controlled by this node (e.g. inita; may specify multiple times) (arisen::producer_plugin)
producer-name = youraccount
```

### 3. Set the Producer's signature-provider

You will need to set the private key for your producer. The public key should have an authority for the producer account defined above. 

`signature-provider` is defined with a 3-field tuple:
* `public-key` - A valid ARISEN public key in form of a string.
* `provider-spec` - It's a string formatted like <provider-type>:<data>
* `provider-type` - KEY or AWALLETD

#### Using a Key:

```console
# config.ini:

signature-provider = PUBLIC_SIGNING_KEY=KEY:PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY

//Example
//signature-provider = RSN7yTxtZr3EKN4S8pE1rrRHjYzXN3SnZCzq77zj4dzwFcrJC97jp=KEY:5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3
```

#### Using Awalletd:
You can also use `awalletd` instead of hard-defining keys. 

```console
# config.ini:

signature-provider = AWALLETD:<data>   

//Example
//RSN7yTxtZr3EKN4S8pE1rrRHjYzXN3SnZCzq77zj4dzwFcrJC97jp=AWALLETD:https://127.0.0.1:88888
```

### 4. Define a peers list

```console
# config.ini:

# Default p2p port is 9876
p2p-peer-address = 123.255.78.9:9876
```

### 5. Load the Required Plugins

In your [config.ini](../index.md), confirm the following plugins are loading or append them if necessary. 

```console
# config.ini:

plugin = arisen::chain_plugin
plugin = arisen::producer_plugin
```
