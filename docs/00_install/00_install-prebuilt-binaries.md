## Location of ARISEN binaries

After installing the prebuilt packages, the actual ARISEN binaries will be located under:
* `/usr/opt/arisen/<version-string>/bin` (Linux-based); or
* `/usr/local/Cellar/arisen/<version-string>/bin` (MacOS)

where `version-string` is the ARISEN version that was installed.

Also, soft links for each ARISEN program (`aos`, `arisecli`, `awalletd`, etc.) will be created under `usr/bin` or `usr/local/bin` to allow them to be executed from any directory.

## Previous Versions

To install previous versions of the ARISEN prebuilt binaries:

1. Browse to https://github.com/arisenio/arisen/tags and select the actual version of the ARISEN software you need to install.

2. Scroll down past the `Release Notes` and download the package or archive that you need for your OS.

3. Follow the instructions on the first paragraph above to install the selected prebuilt binaries on the given OS.
